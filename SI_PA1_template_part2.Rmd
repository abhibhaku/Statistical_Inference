TITLE - Basic Inferential Data Analysis Instructions

OVERVIEW - Goal is to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Q1 - Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analysis

library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
data("ToothGrowth")

str(ToothGrowth) # checking the dataset and class of variables
unique(ToothGrowth$len) # checking for unique values in variable len
unique(ToothGrowth$supp) # checking for unique values in variable supp
unique(ToothGrowth$dose) # checking for unique values in variable dose

# plotting boxplot for the dataset

ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=factor(dose), y=len, fill=factor(dose))) + geom_boxplot()+facet_grid(.~supp) + ggtitle("Analysis of ToothGrowth data")

# Result for Q1 - The plot indicates that high length is associated with high dosage for both OJ & VC

# Q2 - Provide a basic summary of the data

summary(ToothGrowth) # summarizing each variable of the dataset

# Q3 - Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)

# Comparing toothgrowth by supplement using a t-test

# Null Hypothesis - Supplement type has no effect on tooth growth

t.test(len~supp,data = ToothGrowth)

# p-value comes out to be 0.06, which is greater than 0.05 & the confidence interval contains 0 - thus, we can't reject the null hypthesis

# Comparing toothgrowth by dosage using a t-test

# Null Hypothesis - higher dosage level is associated with increased tooth growth

# First subsetiing the data into 3 groups as per the dosage levels

Tg1 <- subset(ToothGrowth,dose %in% c(0.5,1.0))
Tg2 <- subset(ToothGrowth,dose %in% c(0.5,2.0))
Tg3 <- subset(ToothGrowth,dose %in% c(1.0,2.0))

# running t-test for dosage 0.5 & 1.0, 0.5 & 2.0 and 1.0 & 2.0

t.test(len~dose,data = Tg1)
t.test(len~dose,data = Tg2)
t.test(len~dose,data = Tg3)

# For all 3 cases, p-value < 0.05 and zero doesn't lie in their confidence interval range - thus, we can reject the null hypthesis

# Conclusions - 

# 1) Supplement type has no effect on tooth growth
# 2) High dosage levels lead to increased tooth growth

# Assumptions - 

# 1) Variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
# 2) Variances of tooth growth are different when using different supplement and dosage
# 3) Sample dataset is represntative of the population and follows a normal distribution
